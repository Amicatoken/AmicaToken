Introducing Amica Token, a culmination of blockchain’s ability to connect people and add value to things we once couldn’t quantify. 
Amica Token uses a token to create a Web3 based world where users can interact with NFTs at various price points to battle and transact their NFTs;
this is known as the Amicaverse. Amica ties this world to Amica Clothing, which acts as embodiments of one’s assets.

Amica aims to solve the pay-to-play problem with Crypto, as well as revolutionize what it means for something to have value, both in terms of fungible 
and non-fungible assets within Amica Banking. Amica is led by a team of innovators with distinct skillsets and supported by brilliant engineers and creators.

Amica aims to be amicable – a friend to all.
